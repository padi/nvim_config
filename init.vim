" From: "How to do 90% of What Plugins Do w/ Just Vim" by Thoughtbot
" Youtube Channel
" COVERS:
" - Basic Setup
" - Fuzzy File Search
" - Tag jumping
" - Autocomplete
" - File browsing
" - Snippets
" - Build Integration (if we have time)
"
" BASIC SETUP:
" enter current millenium vim
" set nocompatible

" enable syntax and plugins
syntax enable
filetype plugin on

" FUZZY FILE SEARCH:
" Search down into subfolders
" Provides tab completion for all file-related tasks
set path+=**
" Display all matching files when tabbing while using :find
set wildmenu
" NOW WE CAN:
" - Hit tab to :find by partial match
" - Use * to make :find fuzzy
" THINGS TO CONSIDER
" - :b lets you autocomplete any open buffer

" TAG JUMPING:
" create the `tags` file for (may need to install ctags first)
command! MakeTags !ctags -R .
" NOW WE CAN
" - Use ^] to jump to tag under cursor
" - Use g^] for ambiguous tags
" - Use ^t to jump back the tag stack
" THINGS TO CONSIDER
" - This doesn't help if you want a visual list of tags

" AUTOCOMPLETE:
" The good stuff is documented on |ins-completion|
" HIGHLIGHTS:
" - ^x^n for just this file
" - ^x^f for filenames (works with path trick)
" - ^x^] for tags only
" - ^n for anything specified by the complete option
" NOW WE CAN:
" - Use ^n and ^p to go back and forth between the suggestion list

" FILE BROWSING:
" Tweaks for browsing
" let g:netrw_banner = 0        " disable annoying banner
let g:netrw_browse_split = 4  " open in prior window
let g:netrw_altv = 1          " open splits to the right
let g:netrw_liststyle = 3     " tree view
let g:netrw_list_hide = netrw_gitignore#Hide()
let g:netrw_list_hide.=',\(^\|\s\s\)\zs\.\S\+'
" NOW WE CAN:
" - :edit a folder to open a file browser
" - <CR>/v/t to open h-split/v-split/tab
" - check |netrw-browse-maps| for more mappings

" SNIPPETS:
" Read an empty HTML template and move cursor to title
" (WARNING: .skeleton.html must exist!)
nnoremap ,html :-1read $HOME/.config/nvim/.skeleton.html<CR>3jwf>a

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

" ================ Custom Settings ========================
